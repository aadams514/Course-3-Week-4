## Recommend that you run each line, one at a time as the data file is large and can take time for the computer to process the information.
## The code takes the following steps to take the Raw data and turn it into a tidy data set.
## 1. Loads the dply and data.table packages.
## 2. Creates a folder for the data, downloads the data, and then unzips and places data in created folder.
## 3. Pulls the data into R as separate tables.
## 4. Merges the the training and testing data sets into one overarching data set.
## 5. Removes duplicate columns/data that can cause issues when trying to tidy and analyze the data.
## 6. Renames the codes for activities to the words they represent.
## 7. Makes a table withonly the mean and standard deviation data.
## 8. Updates the names of each column to make the table more easily understood.
## 9. Creates a separate tidy data set that summarizes all the columns by subject and event.
